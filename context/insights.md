## 2025-01-08 - Mobile Navbar Shake & Performance Issues
**Key Discovery**: CSS `transition: all` caused navbar shake during mobile section expansion

**Root Cause Analysis**: `transition: all 0.6s` on `.mobile-expanded` triggered excessive browser layout recalculations affecting the fixed navbar
- **Performance Impact**: Broad transitions cause layout reflows beyond intended elements
- **Solution**: Changed to `transition: transform` + `will-change: transform` for browser optimization

**Pattern Observations**:
- `transition: all` can have unintended side effects on other page elements
- Fixed position elements particularly sensitive to layout recalculations
- Performance hints like `will-change` significantly improve animation smoothness
- Backdrop filters expensive on mobile devices during animations

**Implementation Insights**:

## 2025-01-06 - Mobile Title Visibility & CSS Cascade
**Key Discovery**: CSS cascade conflicts between media queries caused inconsistent behavior

**Root Cause Analysis**: `@media (max-width: 768px)` rule had `opacity: 1` making titles always visible on tablets
- **Cascade Conflict**: Tablet styles overrode mobile styles due to CSS specificity
- **Solution**: Used `opacity: 0 !important` to ensure consistent behavior across all mobile devices

**Pattern Observations**:
- Media query boundaries can create unexpected behavior in overlapping ranges
- CSS cascade becomes complex with multiple responsive breakpoints
- User expectations for "mobile behavior" include tablets in many cases
- Testing across different device sizes reveals cascade conflicts

**Implementation Insights**:
- Use `!important` judiciously to resolve cascade conflicts
- Test responsive behavior at boundary values (e.g., exactly 768px)
- Consider mobile-first approach to avoid cascade conflicts
- Document media query breakpoints and their intended behavior

**Actionable Conclusions**:
- Responsive design requires careful consideration of cascade interactions
- Mobile and tablet experiences should be consistent unless specifically differentiated
- Testing should include boundary conditions between breakpoints
- CSS architecture should minimize cascade conflicts through clear hierarchy

## 2025-01-04 - Desktop Hover Effects on Mobile
**Key Discovery**: Desktop `:hover` effects persist on mobile devices creating confusing UX

**Root Cause Analysis**: Mobile devices interpret CSS `:hover` as persistent click state
- **Persistent State**: Coder section stayed colored/scaled when clicking other sections
- **Transform Inheritance**: Navbar signature expanded along with mobile section scaling
- **Solution**: Added mobile-specific overrides with `transform: none !important`

**Pattern Observations**:
- Mobile devices handle hover states differently than desktop
- Transform properties can inherit unexpectedly through parent-child relationships
- CSS specificity becomes critical when overriding hover effects
- Mobile users expect immediate visual feedback, not hover persistence

**Implementation Insights**:
- Always test hover effects on actual mobile devices
- Use transform isolation techniques (`translateZ(0)`, `transform-style: preserve-3d`)
- Mobile-specific CSS overrides often necessary for hover effects
- Consider mobile-first design to avoid hover-related issues

**Actionable Conclusions**:
- Desktop and mobile interaction patterns are fundamentally different
- CSS hover effects need explicit mobile handling
- Transform properties require careful consideration of inheritance
- User testing on actual devices reveals issues that desktop simulation misses
