- **Impact**: Users experienced loading times especially on page reloads
- **Solution**: Implemented 1-hour localStorage cache for RSS feed data

### Caching Strategy Design
- **Cache Duration**: 1 hour (3,600,000 milliseconds) - balances freshness with performance
- **Storage Method**: Browser localStorage - persistent across page reloads
- **Cache Keys**: Separate keys for data (`rss_feed_cache`) and timestamp (`rss_feed_cache_timestamp`)
- **Expiration Logic**: Check timestamp on load, use cached data if fresh, fetch new if stale

### Implementation Details
- **Cache Check**: On page load, check if cached data exists and is less than 1 hour old
- **Fresh Data**: Use cached data immediately if available and fresh
- **Stale Data**: Fetch new data if cache is older than 1 hour or missing
- **Cache Update**: Store fresh data and current timestamp after successful fetch

### Technical Benefits
- **Instant Loading**: Page loads instantly on reload within 1 hour
- **Reduced API Calls**: Fewer requests to CORS proxy service
- **Better UX**: Improved user experience with faster navigation

- **Debug Support**: Easy to inspect and clear cache for development

### Performance Impact
- **First Load**: Same as before (fetch from API)
- **Subsequent Loads**: Near-instant if within 1 hour
- **Cache Miss**: Automatic fallback to fresh fetch
- **User Experience**: Significant improvement for repeat visitors

### Future Enhancements
- **Smart Cache**: Could implement cache invalidation based on content changes
- **Progressive Loading**: Could show cached content while fetching updates
- **Cache Status**: Could add UI indicator showing cache status
- **Multiple Cache Levels**: Could implement different cache durations for different content

### Lessons Learned
- **Cache Duration**: 1 hour is good balance for RSS feeds (not too stale, good performance)
- **localStorage**: Reliable for client-side caching across browser sessions
- **Timestamp Approach**: More reliable than trusting cache headers from external APIs
- **Debug Tools**: Essential for development and troubleshooting cache issues
