# Project State - Frank Cozzolino Website

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Mobile Title Click Visibility Fix - Titles Only Show When Clicked**

### Last Completed Action (Issue #39 - Mobile Title Display)
- **Hide Default State**: Removed base mobile overlay visibility - titles now hidden by default as requested
- **Click-Only Visibility**: Enhanced `.mobile-expanded .content-overlay` to show titles ONLY when sections are clicked
- **Prominent Title Display**: Increased clicked title size to 1.8rem with strong text shadows and contrast
- **Label Enhancement**: Section labels now 1.1rem with 700 font-weight, letter-spacing, and uppercase styling
- **Background Optimization**: Stronger gradient (rgba 0.95/0.8/0.5) for better text readability when clicked
- **Result**: Titles are completely hidden by default and prominently displayed only when mobile sections are clicked

### Implementation Details
- **User Clarification**: "the title is not visible at all it was not an issue of transparency, there is no title. and i dont want title when the section is not clicked"
- **Root Cause**: Previous fix incorrectly added base overlay visibility, but user wants titles hidden by default
- **Technical Solution**:
  - Set `.content-overlay { opacity: 0 !important; }` for mobile default state
  - Enhanced `.mobile-expanded .content-overlay` with stronger visibility and styling
  - Increased title prominence: 1.8rem font-size with 3px shadow and z-index 20
  - Section labels: 1.1rem, font-weight 700, letter-spacing 2px, uppercase
  - Stronger background gradient for better text contrast when clicked
- **Behavior**: Clean sections by default, prominent titles only on click

### Previous Action (Mobile Overlay Visibility & Social Icon Proximity Fix)
- **Overlay Visibility**: Fixed missing section titles on mobile click by adding base `opacity: 1` to mobile content overlay
- **Social Icon Proximity**: Eliminated gap between signature and social icons with `gap: 0rem` + negative margin `margin-top: -0.3rem`
- **Mobile Title Display**: Added mobile-specific overlay styling with optimal gradient and padding
- **Touch Feedback**: Ensured immediate title/description visibility on mobile click
- **Visual Cohesion**: Social icons now appear visually connected to signature as requested
- **Result**: Section titles are now immediately visible on mobile click, and social icons are positioned tight against signature
