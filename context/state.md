# Current Project State

## ✅ COMPLETED: WhatsApp Phone Number Removal (January 2025)

### Latest Task Completed:
**WhatsApp Phone Number Removed** - Successfully removed the specific phone number from WhatsApp link

### Changes Made:
- **WhatsApp Link Updated**: Changed from `https://wa.me/41791234567` to `https://wa.me/your-number`
- **Link Structure Preserved**: WhatsApp icon and functionality maintained, just without specific number
- **File**: `sailing-timeline.html` updated

### Current Status of Data Separation:
- ✅ **JSON Data File**: `sailing-timeline-data.json` created with all sailing timeline data
- ⚠️ **HTML File**: Currently still has hardcoded timeline items (needs to be updated to load from JSON)
- ✅ **WhatsApp Privacy**: Phone number removed as requested

### Completed Previous Tasks:
1. **2024 Sailboat Sale**: Added proper timeline entry positioned between 2025 and 2023
2. **Banner Simplification**: Streamlined to photo + availability message  
3. **2016 Sailboat Ownership**: Added purchase timeline entry
4. **Navigation Consistency**: Professional navbar across all pages
5. **Timeline Reversal**: Newest entries first chronological order
6. **2025 Entries**: Added Gibraltar coastal skipper and Morocco trips

### Next Steps Needed:
1. **Complete JSON Integration**: Update sailing-timeline.html to load timeline data from JSON file
2. **Fix 2024 Positioning**: Ensure 2024 sailboat sale appears in correct chronological order
3. **Test JSON Loading**: Verify dynamic timeline generation works correctly

### Data Structure:
- **Timeline Data**: Organized in `sailing-timeline-data.json` with proper types (certification, milestone, training, trip)
- **Chronological Order**: 2025 → 2024 → 2023 → 2022 → 2019 → 2018 → 2017 → 2016 → 2013 → Pre-2013
- **Complete Ownership Arc**: 2016 purchase and 2024 sale properly documented

### Status: 
✅ **WhatsApp Privacy Fixed** - Phone number removed
⚠️ **JSON Integration Pending** - Need to complete the data separation implementation
