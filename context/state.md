### Last Completed Action (Issue #41 - Mobile Title Visibility FIX)
- **PROBLEM RESOLVED**: Fixed 5th reported issue of titles not being visible when clicking mobile sections
- **Proper Positioning**: Changed overlay from `align-items: flex-end` to `align-items: center` for vertical centering
- **Left Alignment**: Added `justify-content: flex-start` for proper horizontal left alignment
- **Full Coverage**: Set `position: absolute` with full top/left/right/bottom positioning
- **High Contrast**: Simplified to solid dark background `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)` for maximum text visibility
- **Clean Typography**: Improved font sizes and text shadows for optimal readability
- **User Request**: "title should be in the middle centered vertically and aligned on the left horizontally"
- **Result**: âœ… Titles now properly appear when sections are clicked - centered vertically, left-aligned horizontally, fully visible

- **Status**: Production ready with new sailing timeline feature

### Last Completed Action (Issue #42 - Mobile Navbar Shake Fix)
- **PROBLEM RESOLVED**: Fixed navbar shake/jitter when clicking sections on mobile devices
- **Root Cause**: `transition: all 0.6s` on `.mobile-expanded` was causing excessive browser layout recalculations affecting the fixed navbar
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Changed `transition: all` to `transition: transform` to only animate the transform property
  - Added `will-change: transform` for browser optimization hints
  - Maintains existing mobile section expansion functionality without navbar interference
- **Technical Details**: The broad `transition: all` was causing layout reflows that affected the fixed navbar during mobile section scaling animations
- **Result**: âœ… Mobile sections now expand smoothly without causing navbar shake or visual artifacts

### Last Completed Action (Issue #43 - Mobile/Tablet Title Visibility Cascade Fix)
- **PROBLEM RESOLVED**: Fixed CSS cascade conflict where tablets (481px-768px) showed titles by default instead of hiding them
- **Root Cause**: The `@media (max-width: 768px)` rule had `opacity: 1` which made titles always visible on tablets
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Changed tablet content overlay from `opacity: 1` to `opacity: 0 !important` to hide titles by default
  - This ensures consistent behavior across all mobile and tablet devices (â‰¤768px)
  - JavaScript click functionality works for both tablets and mobile phones
- **Technical Details**: CSS cascade conflict was making tablets behave differently than intended mobile design
- **Result**: âœ… All devices â‰¤768px now hide titles by default and show them only when sections are clicked

### Last Completed Action (Issue #44 - Mobile Dark Overlay Removal)
- **PROBLEM RESOLVED**: Removed dark overlay that made mobile sections appear "all dark" when clicked
- **Root Cause**: `background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)` created an 80% opaque black overlay covering entire sections
- **User Request**: "remove the overlay" - wanted to eliminate the dark background completely
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Changed overlay background from `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)` to `background: none` 
  - Enhanced text shadows for readability without overlay: double-layer shadows with 0.9 opacity
  - Updated both title and label shadows for consistent visibility against background images
- **Technical Details**: Removed overlay background while maintaining text readability through enhanced shadows
- **Result**: âœ… Mobile sections now show beautiful background images when clicked with clearly readable white text (no dark overlay)

### Last Completed Action (Issue #45 - Mobile Navbar Shake Complete Fix)
- **PROBLEM RESOLVED**: Eliminated navbar/signature shake when clicking mobile sections by removing performance-intensive backdrop blur
- **Root Cause**: `backdrop-filter: blur(15px)` on navbar was causing expensive recalculation during mobile section `transform: scale(1.25)` animations
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - Removed `backdrop-filter` on mobile devices (â‰¤480px and â‰¤360px)
  - Replaced with optimized static gradient background: `rgba(25, 35, 45, 0.9-0.95)`
  - Maintains visual consistency without performance overhead
  - Desktop blur effect preserved for larger screens
- **Technical Details**: Backdrop filters require GPU-intensive recalculation during animations, causing visual jitter on mobile devices
- **Result**: âœ… Navbar and signature remain completely stable during mobile section clicks, no shake or transition effects

### Last Completed Action (Issue #46 - Mobile Section Color Persistence & Signature Scaling Fix)
- **PROBLEM RESOLVED**: Fixed coder section remaining in color when other sections clicked + signature expanding with sections
- **Root Cause**: Desktop hover effects (`:hover` CSS) persisted on mobile devices and signature transform was affected by section scaling
- **Issues Fixed**:
  1. **Desktop hover persistence**: Coder section stayed colored/scaled when clicking other sections on mobile
  2. **Signature scaling inheritance**: Navbar signature expanded along with mobile section scaling
- **Solution Applied**: 
  - **Mobile hover override**: Added `transform: none !important` and `z-index: auto !important` to disable desktop hover effects on mobile
  - **Signature isolation**: Added `transform: translateZ(0)` to navbar and `transform-style: preserve-3d` to signature for transform isolation
  - **Applied to both breakpoints**: Fixed on both 480px and 360px mobile breakpoints
- **Technical Details**: Mobile devices interpret CSS `:hover` as persistent click state, requiring explicit mobile overrides
- **Result**: âœ… Sections properly reset color when others are clicked, navbar signature remains stable during section expansion
