# Project State - Frank Cozzolino Website

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Enhanced Mobile Signature Prominence**

### Last Completed Action (Issue #30)
- **Signature Enhancement**: Scaled mobile signature 2x larger (scale(2.0))
- **Icon Positioning**: Moved icons closer to signature (gap: 0.2rem)
- **Navbar Expansion**: Increased mobile navbar height (110px) to contain larger signature
- **Extra Small Adjustment**: Proportional scaling for 360px screens (scale(1.6), height: 95px)
- **Result**: Prominent signature with tightly grouped icons, all contained within navbar bounds

### Implementation Details
- **Problem**: Mobile signature too small (scale 1.3) with icons positioned too far away (gap 0.5rem)
- **User Feedback**: "Signature bigger 2x and icons closer to signature should stay within the navbar"
- **Solution**: Doubled signature scale, reduced icon gap, increased navbar height for containment
- **Mobile Changes**: scale(2.0), gap(0.2rem), height(110px)
- **Extra Small Changes**: scale(1.6), gap(0.15rem), height(95px)
- **Priority**: Signature prominence with tight icon grouping

### Technical Changes
- **Mobile Navbar**: Height increased from 85px to 110px for signature containment
- **Mobile Signature**: Scaling increased from scale(1.3) to scale(2.0) for 2x size
- **Mobile Icon Gap**: Reduced from 0.5rem to 0.2rem for closer positioning
- **Extra Small Navbar**: Height increased from 80px to 95px for proportional scaling
- **Extra Small Signature**: Scaling increased from scale(1.0) to scale(1.6) proportionally
- **Result**: Prominent signature with tight icon grouping across all mobile screen sizes
