## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Mobile Overlay Visibility & Social Icon Proximity Fix**

### Last Completed Action (Issue #38 - Mobile UX Critical Fixes)
- **Overlay Visibility**: Fixed missing section titles on mobile click by adding base `opacity: 1` to mobile content overlay
- **Social Icon Proximity**: Eliminated gap between signature and social icons with `gap: 0rem` + negative margin `margin-top: -0.3rem`
- **Mobile Title Display**: Added mobile-specific overlay styling with optimal gradient and padding
- **Touch Feedback**: Ensured immediate title/description visibility on mobile click
- **Visual Cohesion**: Social icons now appear visually connected to signature as requested
- **Result**: Section titles are now immediately visible on mobile click, and social icons are positioned tight against signature

### Implementation Details
- **User Issues**: "title not visible of the section, social icon still too far down"
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  - Mobile `.content-overlay` defaulted to `opacity: 0` with no base visibility rule in 480px media query
  - Social icon `gap: 0.08rem` still created visual separation between signature and icons
- **Technical Solution**:
  - Added base mobile overlay: `opacity: 1 !important` with optimized gradient in 480px media query
  - Set `gap: 0rem` for both 480px and 360px breakpoints
  - Added `margin-top: -0.3rem` to social icons for tight visual proximity
  - Enhanced overlay background with better contrast ratios
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Applied fixes to both 480px and 360px mobile breakpoints

### Previous Action (Mobile Image Click Expansion Fix)
- **Issue**: Mobile image click caused dramatic 150vh full-screen expansion instead of subtle effect
- **Root Cause**: CSS rules used `height: 150vh !important` for full viewport takeover
- **Solution Applied**: Replaced dramatic expansion with subtle 15% scaling + visible overlay
- **Key Changes**: 
  - Removed `height: 150vh` from `.mobile-expanded-top/bottom/both` classes
  - Added `transform: scale(1.15)` to `.mobile-expanded` for subtle section growth
  - Changed image scaling from `scale(0.8)` to `scale(1.05)` for slight image enlargement
  - Enhanced overlay visibility with `opacity: 1 !important` and optimized gradient
  - Refined text sizing: h2 to 1.4rem, label to 0.9rem with improved contrast
- **Result**: Mobile click now shows gentle 15% expansion with prominently visible title and description
