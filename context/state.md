# PROJECT STATE - Frank Cozzolino Website

## ⚠️ LATEST UPDATE - NAVBAR GRADIENT TRANSPARENCY IMPLEMENTED
- **Enhancement**: Replaced uniform 15% opacity with gradient transparency for softer edges
- **Technical**: Implemented `linear-gradient(to bottom, 5% → 15% → 5%)` for fade effect
- **Visual Result**: Navbar edges (top/bottom) now fade smoothly into background images
- **User Benefit**: More natural, blurred edge transition instead of hard navbar boundaries

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - OFFICIAL BRAND ICONS IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue**: Font Awesome icons were NOT the official brand icons for each company
- **Fix**: Replaced all Font Awesome icons with official SVG icons directly from each brand
- **Changed Icons**: WhatsApp, Discord, LinkedIn, Instagram, Gmail, GitHub  
- **Technical**: Removed Font Awesome CDN, updated CSS selectors from `color` to `fill` for SVG styling
- **Result**: Now using authentic official brand icons exactly as companies designed them
